                A simple To Do List app built with React. I built this application to practice using
                ES6 and get a better understanding of React and Webpack. This application features two-way
                data-binding, persisting state with local storage and live state editing. The power of React's
                state and virtual dom were an absolute joy to learn and use. React quickly became
                my favorite framework (or library!?) and I am excited to work on future applications utilizing it.
